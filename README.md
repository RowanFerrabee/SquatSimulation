# Articul8 Squat Simulation Software

This module simulates the mechanics of a human squat movement. Moments and forces on body segments are simualted throughout the movement.  The following squatting factors are also added varied in the simulated movement and analyzed:
- Hip Line Angle
- Frontal Knee Positioning
- Saggital Angle Progression of Tibia
- Foot Positioning
- Depth
- Trunk Positioning

Virtual IMU sensors are placed on the body to determine their readings throughout the movements.  The ability of the IMUs to detect and classify erroneous movement is evaluated.
